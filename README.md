This is a ESP-IDF library for the SHT4X Digital Humidity + Temp sensor.

Forked from the offical Adafruit Library and modified to be compaitble with the ESP-IDf framework natively; it doesn't require `Arduino core`, nor the `Adafruit BusIO` library.

For use with ESP32 devices.

It is designed specifically to work with the SHT4X Digital in the Adafruit shop:

These sensors use **I2C** to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface
